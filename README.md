# Discovery of Physics from Data
Code to accompany the paper *Discovery of Physics from Data: Universal Laws and Discrepancies*.

The figures from the paper were all generated using the Jupyter notebook `generate_figures.ipynb`. Likewise, the figures from the supplementary material were generated with `supplementary_material.ipynb`.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebooks you will need the following Python packages. We give the versions of each package used when generating the figures for the paper.

```
Matplotlib (3.1.2)
Numpy (1.18.1)
Pandas (0.25.3)
Python (3.7.5)
Scikit-learn (0.22.1)
Scipy (1.4.1)
Seaborn (0.9.0)
```

You can install these packages with pip via

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some examples in the supplementary material additionally use the following package.

```
PySINDy (0.12.0)
```

PySINDy can be installed with

```
pip install pysindy
```
