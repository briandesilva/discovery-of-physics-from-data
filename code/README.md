# Code

This folder contains code accompanying the paper *Discovering Physics from Data: Universal laws and Discrepancies*
in the form of two Jupyter notebooks. `generate_figures.ipynb` was used to generate the figures in the main
paper and `supplementary material` was used for the figures in the supplementary material. Interactive versions
of both notebooks are available via binder.
